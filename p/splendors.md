## The Splendors and Mist(eries) of Romanian Digital Literary Studies: a State-of-the-Art just before Horizons 2020 closes off

### Reference

### Abstract

The present article is a snapshot of Digital Literary Studies (DLS) in the present-day Romanian academia, higher education curricula, and research evaluation. In the first part, the emphasis falls on the term ―digital turn‖ and on its specific uses and extensions in humanities, as DH (digital humanities), on the one hand, and as digital literary studies/ computer literary studies (DLS/ CLS)/ com-putational linguistics (CL), on the other. In the second part, we zoom in the field of DLS/ CLS and analyze the way in which ithas been localized, operationalized, institutionalized and understood in the Romanian academic environment and pub-lications (DH-targeted journals, humanities journals, and cultural magazines), in higher education curricula (master/ bachelor programs of study), and in designing evaluation standards for DH/ DLS/ CLS research projects (methodologies for funding national research). In the third part, we provide a down-to-earth approach to Romanian DLS by bringing out the experience with digitization, format conversion, manual cleaning, encoding, annotation, and with various editing, quantitative analysis, and data management tools (AntConc, TXM, StyloR, Nooj, Heurist, Transkribus, Oxygen etc.), acquired throughout the implementation of Hai-Ro Project (Hajduk Novels in Romania during the Long Nineteenth Century: digital edition and corpus analysis assisted by computer tools).

### Abstract

In Romania, among the academic personalities, Solomon Marcus (b. the 1st of March 1925, Bacău – d. the 17th of March 2016, Bucharest) was perhaps the only one who happily combined linguistics and mathematics, being known in the Romanian philological environment especially for Lingvistica matematică [Mathematical Linguistic], Modele matematice în lingvistică [Mathematical Models in Linguistics], 1963, 1966, and Poetica matematică [Mathematical Poetics], in 1970, and in the international scientific field for numerous translation and also for numerous papers published in prestigious publishing houses in Paris, New York and Bologna. Grounded in the Distant reading paradigm (i.e. using digital humanities in analyzing large collection of literary texts) the paper, From close and to distant reading of Romanian novels from 1850 to 1920 provides a historical classification of texts in order to be included in a multilingual European Literary text Collection (ELTeC), permitting to test methods and compare results across national traditions and consider the consequences of such resources and methods for rethinking fundamental concepts in literary history. The paper is following main ideas in relation with the consequences of an absent research field in Romanian academic studies, digital humanities: Close and distant reading in digital humanities: Romanian literature case from 1850 to 1920; Romanian literary history and ways of transnational knowledge through Distant Reading of literary facts: 100 Romanian novels from 1850 to 1920; Transnational redefinition of periods in national history through a literary species: the novel; The problem of "translation / export" of national literary histories.

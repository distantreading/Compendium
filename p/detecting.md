### Abstract

Fictional prose can be broadly divided into narrative and discursive forms with direct speech being central to any discourse representa-tion (alongside indirect reported speech and free indirect discourse). This distinction is crucial in digital literary studies and enables in-teresting forms of narratological or stylistic analysis. The difficulty of automatically detecting direct speech, however, is currently un-der-estimated. Rule-based systems that work reasonably well for modern languages struggle with (the lack of) typographical conven-tions in 19th-century literature. While machine learning approaches to sequence modeling can be applied to solve the task, they typi-cally face a severed skewness in the availability of training material, especially for lesser resourced languages. In this paper, we reportthe result of a multilingual approach to direct speech detection in a diverse corpus of 19th-century fiction in 9 European languages.The proposed method fine-tunes a transformer architecture with multilingual sentence embedder on a minimal amount of annotatedtraining in each language, and improves performance across languages with ambiguous direct speech marking, in comparison to acarefully constructed regular expression baseline.

	abstract = {This paper explores the effectiveness of parallel stylometric document embeddings in solving the authorship attribution task by testing a novel approach on literary texts in 7 different languages, totaling in 7051 unique 10,000-token chunks from 700 PoS and lemma annotated documents. We used these documents to produce four document embedding models using Stylo R package (word-based, lemma-based, PoS-trigrams-based, and PoS-mask-based) and one document embedding model using mBERT for each of the seven languages. We created further derivations of these embeddings in the form of average, product, minimum, maximum, and l2 norm of these document embedding matrices and tested them both including and excluding the mBERT-based document embeddings for each language. Finally, we trained several perceptrons on the portions of the dataset in order to procure adequate weights for a weighted combination approach. We tested standalone (two baselines) and composite embeddings for classification accuracy, precision, recall, weighted-average, and macro-averaged F1-score, compared them with one another and have found that for each language most of our composition methods outperform the baselines (with a couple of methods outperforming all baselines for all languages), with or without mBERT inputs, which are found to have no significant positive impact on the results of our methods.},

In Romania, among the academic personalities, Solomon Marcus (b. the 1st of March 1925, Bacău – d. the 17th of March 2016, Bucharest) was perhaps the only one who happily combined linguistics and mathematics, being known in the Romanian philological environment especially for Lingvistica matematică [Mathematical Linguistic], Modele matematice în lingvistică [Mathematical Models in Linguistics], 1963, 1966, and Poetica matematică [Mathematical Poetics], in 1970, and in the international scientific field for numerous translation and also for numerous papers published in prestigious publishing houses in Paris, New York and Bologna. Grounded in the Distant reading paradigm (i.e. using digital humanities in analyzing large collection of literary texts) the paper, From close and to distant reading of Romanian novels from 1850 to 1920 provides a historical classification of texts in order to be included in a multilingual European Literary text Collection (ELTeC), permitting to test methods and compare results across national traditions and consider the consequences of such resources and methods for rethinking fundamental concepts in literary history. The paper is following main ideas in relation with the consequences of an absent research field in Romanian academic studies, digital humanities: Close and distant reading in digital humanities: Romanian literature case from 1850 to 1920; Romanian literary history and ways of transnational knowledge through Distant Reading of literary facts: 100 Romanian novels from 1850 to 1920; Transnational redefinition of periods in national history through a literary species: the novel; The problem of "translation / export" of national literary histories.},

	abstract = {Fictional prose can be broadly divided into narrative and discursive forms with direct speech being central to any discourse representa-tion (alongside indirect reported speech and free indirect discourse). This distinction is crucial in digital literary studies and enables in-teresting forms of narratological or stylistic analysis. The difficulty of automatically detecting direct speech, however, is currently un-der-estimated. Rule-based systems that work reasonably well for modern languages struggle with (the lack of) typographical conven-tions in 19th-century literature. While machine learning approaches to sequence modeling can be applied to solve the task, they typi-cally face a severed skewness in the availability of training material, especially for lesser resourced languages. In this paper, we reportthe result of a multilingual approach to direct speech detection in a diverse corpus of 19th-century fiction in 9 European languages.The proposed method fine-tunes a transformer architecture with multilingual sentence embedder on a minimal amount of annotatedtraining in each language, and improves performance across languages with ambiguous direct speech marking, in comparison to acarefully constructed regular expression baseline.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the application of LDA topic modeling to a corpus of poetry. First, it explains how the most coherent LDA-topics have been established by running several tests and automatically evaluating the coherence of the resulting LDA-topics. Results show, on one hand, that when dealing with a corpus of poetry, lemmatization is not advisable because several poetic features are lost in the process; and, on the other hand, that a standard LDA algorithm is better than a specific version of LDA for short texts (LF-LDA). The resulting LDA-topics have then been manually analyzed in order to define the relation between word topics and poems. The analysis shows that there are mainly two kinds of semantic relations: an LDA-topic could represent the subject or theme of the poem, but it could also represent a poetic motif. All these analyses have been undertaken on a large corpus of Golden Age Spanish sonnets. Finally, the paper shows the most relevant themes and motifs in this corpus such as "love", "religion", "heroics", "moral" or "mockery" on one hand, and "rhyme", "marine", "music" or "painting" on the other hand.},

Traditional attentive reading, attributed to “text enjoyment”, which contradicts the understanding of the text itself is only possible... without reading the text. The paper analyzes the content of this paradoxical statement, the system of arguments made by the author of the statement Franco Moretti, the relations between distant reading and the concepts of archive, data, algorithm, textual fact, the application of the Big Data analysis in the humanities, as well as so called digital humanities. The discussion about distant reading and application of the digital technology to text interpretation highlights the connection of these ideas with the visions of a modern reader of the early 20th century, the Russian formalism, finally with the most urgent contemporary question – how to get knowledge from the books you never read?},

Textometry allows the non- linear quantitative and qualitative study of digital corpora, combining lexicometric and statistical research with developed corpus technologies. In this paper, the current version of the srpELTeC corpus was analyzed within the TXM program environment to illustrate the possibilities of the textometric approach and visual presentation of the obtained results.},

	abstract = {Approaching Moore’s poetic oeuvre through the lens of computational stylistic analysis, this chapter poses two related questions. First, what effect does the generic diversity of Moore’s poetic corpus have on his stylistic consistency? Second, what practical and conceptual changes occur in the notion of authorship when we approach it through the methods of computational analysis? The arguments of the preceding chapters have emphasised the value of considering different sources of agency in the construction of an authorial persona, and the book’s conclusion examines some logical consequences of that trajectory. A basic assumption of stylometry—the statistical analysis of literary style—insists that a quantifiable and (often) distinctive aspect of an author’s style is unconscious. As stylistic consistency is often posited as a key characteristic of authorship, is this criterion evident in an author, like Moore, whose verse encompasses lyric, satiric, epic, song and ballad, and epistolary modes, and a wide range of poetic forms? In other words, do genre effects and features supersede an author’s stylistic consistency? This chapter reflects on the implications of digital humanities methods for literary analysis, comparing the nature of the evidence, assumptions, and conclusions of stylometry with those of the methods employed in previous chapters. Ultimately, the book concludes with an argument for the necessity of a broad methodological approach to the study of authorship.},

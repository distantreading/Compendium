# The Distant Reading Compendium 

Welcome to the _Distant Reading Compendium_. This virtual edited volume unites contributions that have emerged from the COST Action _Distant Reading for European Literary History_ (CA16204). 

Note that this edited volume is both virtual (in the sense that the papers included here have first been published elsewhere, in Open Access, and are only referenced and contextualized here) and a work in progress (in the sense that we will add further papers emerging from the COST Action network in the future). 

Reference: _The Distant Reading Compendium_, edited by Christof Schöch and Maciej Eder. Trier: Distant Reading for European Literary History, 2022. URL: [distantreading.github.io/compendium/](https://distantreading.github.io/compendium/), DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.6513699](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6513699). 

## Front Matter

### Introduction to the volume

This introduction presents the COST Action _Distant Reading for European Literature_, which ran from 2017 to 2022, and its key output, the _European Literary Text Collection_ (ELTeC). We aim to structure and summarize the key findings reported on in the various publications that make up this virtual edited volume of publications that have been created by the participants in this networking project. 

## Section 1: Building ELTeC

This section is dedicated to papers describing the process of designing and building the European Literary Text Collection (ELTeC) and encoding the texts contained in each corpus in XML-TEI. 

#### [In Search of Comity: TEI for Distant Reading](/p/comity.md)
**Lou Burnard, Christof Schöch, Carolin Odebrecht**

#### [Creating the European Literary Text Collection (ELTeC): Challenges and Perspectives](/p/creating.md)
**Christof Schöch, Roxana Patraș, Diana Santos, Tomaž Erjavec**

#### [The Serbian Part of the ELTeC – from the Empty List to the 100 Novels Collection](/p/serbian.md)
**Aleksandra Trtovac, Vasilije Milnović, and Cvetana Krstev**

## Section 2: Annotating ELTeC

This section contains papers concerned with the process of adding annotations to one or several ELTeC collections, in particular annotations pertaining to part of speech, dependency relations, and named entities. 

#### [Annotation of the Serbian ELTeC Collection](/p/annotation.md)
**Ranka Stanković, Cvetana Krstev, Branislava Šandrih Todorović, and Mihailo Škorić**

## Section 3: Analysing ELTeC

The papers in this section are dedicated to the analysis of one or several of the corpora contained in ELTeC, with the focus being for example on the titles of the novels or on detecting direct speech. 

#### [Thresholds to the ‘Great Unread’: Titling Practices in Eleven ELTeC Collections](/p/thresholds.md)
**Roxana Patras, Carolin Odebrecht, Ioana Galleron, Rosario Arias, Berenike J. Herrmann, Cvetana Krstev, Katja Mihurko Poniž, Dmytro Yesypenko**

#### Detecting Direct Speech in Multilingual Collection of 19th Century Novels
**Joanna Byszuk, Michał Woźniak, Mike Kestemont, Albert Leśniak, Wojciech Łukasik, Artjoms Šeļa**

## Section 4: Theoretical concerns 

This section is dedicated to papers that address issues of literary theory and literary history that are of concern when digital corpora and algorithmic methods of analysis are used in Literary Studies. 

#### Apie skaitymą iš toli ir iš arti [About Distant and Close Reading]
**Saulius Keturakis**

## Section 5: Beyond ELTeC, beyond the Action

Work in the Action has in many cases also looked beyond ELTeC or beyond the immediate context of the Action to consider more general issues of Distant Reading, Computational Literary Studies, or Digital Humanities. This section contains papers from this angle. 

#### The Splendors and Mist(Eries) of Romanian Digital Literary Studies
**Roxana Patras, Ioana Galleron, Camelia Gradinaru, Ioana Lionte, and Lucreţia Pascaru**

#### Stylometry in a Bilingual Setup
**Silve Cinková and Jan Rybicki**
